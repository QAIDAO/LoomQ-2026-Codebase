# Authoritative Technical Web Links

These links are for development and review. Formal evaluation must use the local contracts and specifications, not live web content.

## OpenQASM standards

| Source | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [Official OpenQASM repository](https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm) | Project governance, released specifications, examples, and reference grammars. |
| [OpenQASM 2.x branch](https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/tree/OpenQASM2.x) | Authoritative OpenQASM 2.0 grammar and language semantics shared by the LoomQ source subset. |
| [OpenQASM live specification](https://openqasm.com/) | OpenQASM 3 language reference. Use only the subset required by the LoomQ Braket target. |
| [OpenQASM releases](https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/releases) | Stable release identification; do not base production behavior on an unreleased development branch. |
| [Qiskit OpenQASM 2 parser API](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/api/qiskit/qasm2) | Maintained `load`/`loads` parser, strict mode, include paths, and legacy `qelib1.inc` compatibility controls used by the pinned frontend. |
| [OpenQASM 2 and Qiskit guide](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/interoperate-qiskit-qasm2) | Official examples and guidance for importing OpenQASM 2 with Qiskit. |

## SpinQit

| Source | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [SpinQit official documentation](https://doc.spinq.cn/doc/spinqit/index.html) | Compiler, circuit, simulator, and backend API reference. |
| [SpinQit official repository](https://github.com/SpinQTech/SpinQit) | Source examples, getting-started material, and release history. |
| [SpinQit 0.2.4 package](https://pypi.org/project/spinqit/0.2.4/) | Package artifact and pinned release metadata. |
| [SpinQ Cloud documentation](https://cloud.spinq.cn/circuitDesign/docs) | Authentication-required cloud UI, circuit execution, task history, result export, SSH-key setup, and account workflow. |
| [SpinQ Cloud QASM Editor documentation](https://cloud.spinq.cn/circuitDesign/docs?page=qasmDoc) | Authentication-required cloud OpenQASM restrictions, per-platform gate tables, automatic measurement, and topology requirements. |
| [SpinQ Cloud MCP documentation](https://cloud.spinq.cn/circuitDesign/docs?page=MCP) | Authentication-required installation, server command, credential variables, and MCP tools. |

The cloud links are advisory for real-machine validation and may require an active signed-in browser session. Live `get_platforms` output overrides stale platform tables. They do not change the formal L1 target contract.

## OriginQ and pyQPanda

| Source | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [pyQPanda documentation](https://pyqpanda-toturial.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/) | CPUQVM, QASM conversion, execution, measurement, and API reference. |
| [QASM and OriginIR conversion documentation](https://pyqpanda-toturial.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/10.%E9%87%8F%E5%AD%90%E7%BA%BF%E8%B7%AF%E7%BC%96%E8%AF%91/index.html) | `convert_qasm_*`, `convert_qprog_to_qasm`, and conversion workflows. |
| [QPanda3 OriginIR specification](https://github.com/OriginQ/QPanda3-doc/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial_04_compilation/tutorial_OriginIR_cn.markdown.in) | Primary OriginIR syntax and instruction families. LoomQ uses a narrower contract. |
| [pyQPanda 3.8.5 package](https://pypi.org/project/pyqpanda/3.8.5/) | Package artifact and pinned release metadata. |
| [Origin Quantum real-computing manual](https://qcloud.originqc.com.cn/document/usermanual/rst/Computing_service1.html) | Current public hardware inventory and console-visible status fields. |
| [QPanda3 cloud service](https://qcloud.originqc.com.cn/document/qpanda-3/cn/d2/d42/tutorial_qcloud_service.html) | Official authenticated `QCloudService.backends()` discovery and cloud execution workflow. |
| [Context7 pyQPanda index](https://context7.com/originq/pyqpanda-toturial/llms.txt) | Optional focused retrieval. Verify every result against pyQPanda 3.8.5 and local tests. |

Context7 library ID: `/originq/pyqpanda-toturial`.

## Refresh policy

- Prefer specifications, vendor documentation, vendor repositories, and official package registries.
- Do not promote search summaries, forum answers, or generated snippets into the local standard without primary-source and executable verification.
- Record changed sources in `sources.lock.json`.
- Keep the pinned environment unchanged until the refreshed knowledge passes all tests.
