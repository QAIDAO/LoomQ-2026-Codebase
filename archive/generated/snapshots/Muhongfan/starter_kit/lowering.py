"""Per-target gate lowering.

tools/gate_audit.py confirmed all 12 whitelist gates run natively on SpinQ
(via its bundled qelib1.inc) and on Braket (via the 5 renames handled in its
emitter). target_ir_contract.md's OriginIR gate list also names all 12
directly. Lowering is therefore a documented no-op for every target today;
it stays in the pipeline as the fallback path if that ever changes (a hidden
circuit edge case, or OriginQ turning out to differ once its API token
arrives and it gets audited).
